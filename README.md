# sQMinimapFix
A quick fix for WoW Vanilla (1.12) to force a constant minimap zoom level across all zones, cities and instances.
No configuration needed. Set your favorite zoom level, forget it.

In this forked version, I added 2 more tweaks.
The first tweak automatically sets your minimap zoom level to the furthest out zoom level. If you want you can change the number on line 53 from 0 to 5. 0 being the furthest zoomed out and 5 being the closest zoomed in.

The second tweak automatically sets your default chat frame to the first frame regardless of the alphabetical order of your frames upon character login. So, your first and most important chat frame will always be selected when you login with your character.
